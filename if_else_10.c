/*
Three contendersâ€” X, Y, and Z are facing off in a duel of divisibility. Your task is to determine the result of this epic showdown by analyzing the relationship between X and its challengers, Y and Z. The rules of the duel are as follows:
If X is divisible by Y, the output should be "Y triumphs over X!".
If X is divisible by Z, the output should be "Z outsmarts X!".
If X is divisible by both Y and Z, the output should be "X defeats all!".
If X is not divisible by either Y or Z, the output should be "X remains undefeated!".
